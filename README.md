# AIT580_Data_Analytics_Project
The final project for the intorductory, survey, and overview course I took in my Masters in Data Analytics Engineering program at GMU. 
I chose the topic of COVID data because I took that course in the Autumn of 2020, and I ued a combination of R, SQL, Python, and Excel to
complete my exploratory comparative data analysis of covid mortality rates and case fatality rates by region.
